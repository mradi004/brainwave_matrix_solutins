1-INTRODUCTION:-
The rise of fake news has made it essential to have automated systems capable of identifying and flagging misinformation. This Fake News Detection System is designed to help classify news articles as either fake or real using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms.

The models are trained on labeled datasets containing real and fake news articles. After training, the system can make predictions on new unseen articles.

2-Installation
To get started, follow the steps below to set up the project locally:

Clone the repository:

bash:-
git clone https://github.com/username/fake-news-detection-system.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
cd fake-news-detection-system
Install the required dependencies using pip:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed along with necessary libraries like:

pandas
scikit-learn
numpy
matplotlib
nltk

Open the Jupyter Notebook to explore or run the project:

bash
jupyter notebook
Open Fake_News_Detection.ipynb from the notebook dashboard and follow the cells to understand how the system works.

3-Dataset:-
The dataset used for training is a collection of real and fake news articles. The key fields are:

text: The content of the news article.
label: A binary label (0 for Fake, 1 for Real)

4-Features
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Clean, preprocess, and tokenize the text data.
TF-IDF Vectorization: Transform text into numerical vectors.
Machine Learning Models:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree Classifier
Gradient Boosting Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
Performance Evaluation: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix

5-Model Training
Text Preprocessing:

The system preprocesses the text by removing noise such as special characters, URLs, and numeric data.
The processed text is then converted to lowercase.
Vectorization:

We use the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) method to convert the preprocessed text data into feature vectors for training.
Model Fitting:

We train several machine learning models and evaluate their performance on the training dataset.
Model Evaluation:

Accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to evaluate the performance of each model

6-Usage
After training the models, you can run the prediction on new text input to detect fake news.

Run the manual_testing(news) function in the notebook by passing a news article as input.
The system will output whether the news is Fake News or Real News.
